  "bio": "    I am a full-stack software developer and game designer based in Nashville, Tennessee. I use the Microsoft tech stack to build web applications and Unity to make games.\n\n    I'm married with a baby boy, two dogs and a cat. I train Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai, work out, and play video games in my spare time. I cooked professionally for 10 years and now I love to cook at home. Coding has been my passion since I modded my first game when I was a young teen and it continues to be my obsession. I try to learn something new every day and stay current with the latest technologies and techniques."
